# Loan_Prediction_Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting loan eligibility for individuals based on their personal and financial details. Various machine learning models are employed to achieve high prediction accuracy.

## Steps Involved
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Data Splitting: Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Model Training: Training various classification models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Bagging Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, and Neural Networks.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the models using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC AUC.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Using RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization.
- Feature Engineering: Using Polynomial Features for creating new features and improving model performance.
- Results and Conclusion: Analyzing the results and selecting the best model for predicting loan eligibility.
